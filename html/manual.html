<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
<p>We open up laws, legislation, and the lawmaking process online so that as many people as possible can see, understand, and shape the policies that affect their lives.</p>
<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
<p>We are former and current government workers, designers, technologists, and concerned citizens who believe in building with, not for, and in partnering directly with users both in and outside of government to find solutions that help bridge the gap between the two. We're focused on long-term solutions, building tools and processes that change the culture of how governments operate.</p>
<p>Everything we create is open source, free for anyone to take and use.</p>
<p>We're building a national network of people like us and the Free Law Founders—to share resources and expertise around solving shared challenges in modernizing the lawmaking process.</p>
