### Reporting and Resolution of Violations
Any employee who believes they have been harassed or believes they have witnessed another member of our organization violate the terms of this document should report the situation immediately to one of the following members of management: Executive Director, Treasurer or Chairman of the Board of Directors. If an employee makes a report to one of these persons and the employee does not receive a satisfactory response, the employee shall report the situation to one of the other designated persons to receive complaints.

The organization will investigate all such reports as confidentially as possible. Adverse action will not be taken against an employee because he or she, in good faith, reports or participates in the investigation of a violation of this policy. Violations of this policy are not permitted and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

### Drug & Alcohol Policy
The unlawful or improper presence or use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace presents a danger to all employees. All members of the organization are prohibited from reporting to work or working while using illegal or unauthorized substances.

Our organization recognizes that drug or alcohol abuse are serious medical conditions and should be treated as such. Therefore, we shall provide all appropriate organizational support and assistance to those within the organization who request it. We will also seek out and retain a employer-sponsored health insurance plan that provide drug and alcohol treatment services.

### Conflict of Interest
Employees must never use their positions with the organization for private gain, to advance personal interests or to obtain favors or benefits for themselves, member of their families or any other individuals, corporations of business entities. Furthermore, employees should avoid situations where a *perception* of a conflict of interest could be created.

Should you encounter a situation that suggests a conflict of interest, please refer the situation the Executive Director, who will in turn seek a determination from the Board of Directors as to whether a conflict exists, and if it exists, whether it is an allowable conflict.

### Professional Conduct
Our organization adheres to the highest legal and ethical standards applicable in our line of work. The organization's business is conducted in strict observance of both the letter and spirit of all applicable laws and the integrity of each employee is of utmost importance.

### Contact with the Media

## Schedule, Hours & Vacation

### Our Schedule

Employees are expected to work 40 hours per week, but we are flexible on where and when that work gets done.

Employees are expected to attend all meetings to which they have been invited as a "required" participant. Communication is vital to the success of our team; therefore, team members are expected to be reasonably accessible by phone, Slack, and email between the hours of 11 AM–4 PM.

Employees are able to work from home and/or remotely and the organization will make all efforts to ensure a comparable work experience regardless of where an employee is located.

Any time that you won't be available during the regular work day (9 PM to 5 PM locally) should be put on your calendar the organization's calendar.

### Vacation & Leave Policy
We are closed on all [Federal holidays](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/holidays-work-schedules-and-pay), the day after Thanksgiving, and during the week between Christmas and the New Year.

We expect everyone to be able to get their work done in a timely fashion, and to not have to work on personal time. Rested and refreshed people are better team members, and we strongly encourage enjoying life outside of the office.

*Employees should take a minimum of two weeks of paid vacation per year, totaling 10 business days.*

For personal, medical, or family leave, each employee is encouraged to take the current [Family and Medical Leave Act](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/benefits-leave/fmla) maximum.

For maternity and paternity leave, employees are encouraged to take up to 16 weeks of leave.

#### Taking Leave
Employees must inform your supervisor in writing as far in advance as is reasonable for staff and project planning purposes. All extended periods of leave must be discussed with the Executive Director.

To schedule time off, permission must be granted by your supervisor no less than 5 business days in advance, the dates your travel must be put onto the team calendar (just invite sayhello [at] opengovfoundation.org), and the team should be notified via email.

### Sick Days
Please notify the team if you are sick and need to take the day off. Even if you are feeling well enough to work, please work from home until you are completely recovered, to avoid spreading illness through our small office.

## How We Work

### Email Accounts, Document Sharing & Password Sharing
We will set you up with an organizational Google Suite account. This will provide you access to all the basic necessities like email, calendar, and shared storage.

Please use your organizational email address for all work-related correspondence, scheduling, etc. Personal accounts should not be used for work-related activities.

You will be granted access to our shared password manager. All passwords that need to be shared with the organization must be shared using this manager; passwords should not be shared via email or other insecure methods.

### Calendars
Please keep your availability updated on your Google calendar account associated with the organization - please don't use your personal account. Please record any meetings, vacation time, appointments, and anything else that your teammates might need to schedule around. Feel free to schedule meetings with other coworkers on the Google calendar.

### Regular Meetings
All meetings must be held in a manner that allows for full participation of all employees, regardless of such individual variables such as geographic location.

#### Daily Standup(s)
To better coordinate organizational or product development efforts, one or more daily standups may be scheduled, each lasting no longer than 15 minutes.

The purpose of the daily standup is to provide a short summary of what you focused on the previous day, what you are planning on focusing on today, and, critically, identification of any obstacles or blockers that may prevent you from completing a task.

Once each participant has completed their summary, the standup may be ended. Should a topic be raised that requires more in depth discussion, a separate meeting should be scheduled.

#### Weekly All Hands
We meet once a week as a complete team for no more than 30 minutes to discuss organization-level topics, share important updates, and, most importantly, celebrate our work through informal talks or product demos. Should a topic be raised that requires more in depth discussion, a separate meeting should be scheduled.

Participation in the weekly standup is required of all organization employees and must allow for the full participation of all employees regardless of geographic location.

#### Book Clubs, "Family" Meals, and Other Informal Rituals
We are a small, close knit team. To maintain a balanced, healthy, and fun organization, we encourage the formation of informal gatherings and groups. Any employee may sponsor an informal gathering or group so as long it is are open to all employees and supports organizational health.

As in any endeavor, it is critical that any informal gathering or group clearly define its purpose and the expectation placed upon its participants.

### Tools & Services We Use
We utilize an ever-changing array of tools and platforms to get our work down. Employees are expected to familiarize themselves with all tools that are applicable to their work areas. Trial and adoption of new tools is encouraged and should be done in a collaborative manner with your colleagues to encourage operational alignment and discourage tool siloing.

We do our best to keep our [tool and platform](tools.md)] list up to date.
